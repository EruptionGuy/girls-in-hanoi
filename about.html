          <p>
            My name is An Thy, a highschool senior from Hanoi, Vietnam. I was
            born and raised in Hanoi, where every street carries a story — yet
            only a few carry women’s names.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Girls in Hanoi” began as a curiosity: why do so few streets in my
            city bear women’s names and what stories hide behind the ones that
            do? But over time, it became something larger—an ongoing project
            about visibility, safety, and belonging. It’s part research, part
            archive, and part love letter to Hanoi’s women: those who built,
            walked, and still navigate the city in quiet strength. I walk the
            same roads my grandmother once sold bánh cuốn on, the same roads
            built by women whose names never reached a street sign. Between the
            noise of motorbikes and the dusk-colored air, I look for the women
            who shaped this place — not always seen, but always present. In this
            project, I blend data, photography, and narrative to map not only
            where women are remembered, but how they exist today. Each page on
            this site holds a fragment of that story. I don’t claim to represent
            every woman’s experience, but I hope this project invites you to
            look closer to the street signs you pass, the corners you overlook,
            and the everyday resilience that fills them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my Hanoi, told through the eyes of its girls, past and
            present.
