            The Ethics of Urban Form: Recognition and Absence in Hanoi's Streetscape
          </h2>

          <h3>The Urban Language of Remembrance</h3>
          <p>
            Street naming is an urban language. Maps tell us who the city
            chooses to remember and whose labor is absorbed into the collective.
            When a woman’s name appears on a sign in Hanoi, it feels sacred—a
            rare moment when her invisible contribution becomes tangible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scarcity of these names, however, is equally revealing. It
            implies that women's stories have often been honored through the
            collective contributions—the tea, the rice, a sustained family—rather
            than as individual brilliance. Their endurance has built the very
            rhythm of Hanoi, but their legacy rarely earns a plaque.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city’s architecture is not just French facades and colonial
            relics; it is also the invisible scaffolding of care that women
            maintain daily: the early market stalls, the patience that holds
            chaos at bay.
          </p>

          <h3>A Constellation of Strength</h3>
          <p>
            The few streets named after women embody this paradox: few, yet
            pulsing with life. They remind us that visibility is not about
            numbers, but about essence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hai Bà Trưng:</strong> A grand boulevard echoing the story
            of the twin sisters who led an uprising, their defiance spanning
            centuries. <br />
            <strong>Bà Triệu:</strong> A gentler street where her spirit of
            defiance lingers in the breeze. <br />
            <strong>Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai:</strong> Her name belongs to modernity,
            representing progress, independence, and education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, they form a quiet constellation—a philosophy of female
            strength written into the city’s geography.
          </p>

          <h3>Beyond the Map: A Philosophy of Work</h3>
          <p>
            Girls in Hanoi was born from this observation, a form of listening
            to what is absent. My philosophy of work is rooted in presence and
            observation: to look at what is missing and recognize that absence
            itself is a powerful narrative. In a city where women’s names are so
            few on signs, my work seeks to create other forms of
            recognition—through narratives, images, and conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking Bà Triệu Street, I see the philosophy of the feminine city:
            not fragile, but balanced; not ornamental, but fundamentally
            grounding. The street’s rhythm is deliberate and free, mirroring the
            cadence of women’s work—the steaming of rolls, the stitching of
            fabric, the quiet, sustaining thought. These are not small acts;
            they are the architecture of living.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps Hanoi has always understood this: women’s immortality is
            made of softer things—the scent of cốm, the sound of laughter, the
            patience that sustains life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't dream of building new streets. I dream of naming the ones
            already there: the invisible roads women walk every day—between home
            and market, love and labor. Every woman is a street of her own,
            carrying stories and meanings that deserve to be mapped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, Hanoi teaches a simple lesson: presence is measured not
            by public acclaim, but by how deeply your work becomes an integral
            part of a place. To walk through this city is to walk through
            women’s work—patient, uncredited, and beautiful—the work that keeps a
            city alive.
